# üîê Secure Data Encryption System ‚Äì Streamlit App

## üìò Introduction

This project is a **Secure Data Encryption System** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. It allows users to safely **encrypt** and **store sensitive information**, then later **retrieve and decrypt** it using a personal passkey. The system features secure password hashing, data encryption with **Fernet (symmetric encryption)**, and an authentication-protected dashboard.

To enhance usability and security, the application includes:
- User login system with hashed master credentials
- Data encryption and decryption functionality
- Failed login attempt tracking and timed lockout mechanism
- A clean and interactive Streamlit interface

## üß† What I Learned

Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in:

- **Python security libraries** like `hashlib` and `cryptography.fernet`
- Implementing **secure password hashing** and **passkey verification**
- Designing a **lockout mechanism** to prevent brute-force attacks
- Building **real-time interactive UIs** using Streamlit
- Managing **session state** and user flow in a web app
- Reading from and writing to **JSON files** for persistent data storage
- Structuring clean, modular, and type-hinted Python code

This project helped me understand how to implement real-world security practices and reinforced the importance of **usability + protection** in software design.
